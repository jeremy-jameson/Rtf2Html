**Note:** This repository is obsolete (and has been for about a decade).

Seriously? It is 2021 -- almost 2022 -- don't even think about using something like Rtf2Html anymore.

There are much better ways of formatting code samples these days. Might I suggest writing blog posts with Markdown and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)?

# Overview
Rtf2Html is a utility to convert RTF to HTML (e.g. to post code samples from Visual Studio to a blog). For more information, see http://www.technologytoolbox.com/blog/jjameson/archive/2009/10/09/formatting-code-for-my-blog.aspx.
